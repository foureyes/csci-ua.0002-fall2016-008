Homework
====
* About one homework assigned per week 
* Turned in **electronically via NYU Classes**
* Homework assignments are due one week after posting
* Late homework policy
	* The assignment will stay open up to 24 hours in NYU classes
	* After the 24 hour grace period, homework cannot be submitted
	* A pattern of late homework will result in zero points for subsequent late homeworks (even if submitted during the grace period)
* [Page on academic integrity](http://www.cs.nyu.edu/webapps/content/academic/undergrad/academic_integrity)
	* However, I do expect some level of collaboration (help debugging, discussing potential solutions, etc.)
	* __But write your own code!__
